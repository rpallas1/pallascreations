# Pallas Creations

Pallas Creations is a website I am building from scratch and will be a place where i can display and explain my artwork for others to see

## Pages

- Home Page
- Gallery Page
- About Page
- Contact Page

### Home Page

- I want this page to have a quick intro into what Pallas Creations is along with a couple of drawings for users to see right away. Under that maybe some quotes from people that have commented on my drawings. And in the footer, have buttons to visit the other pages 

### Gallery Page

- Have a quick explanation of what the gallery is and then have the final draft of all my drawings. Make it so that each drawing will be able to be clicked and users will be able to see what the process of the drawing was like, along with a brief description of each step

### About Page

- Have a description of what Pallas Creations is, how it started, and where I plan to take it

## HTML Layout

Have a .html file for each page, along with somewhere to store the gallery pictures and descriptions 

- `index.html`
    - This will be the home page and will have links to the rest of the webpages
- `gallery.index`
    - This will have the description of what the gallery is and what the users will be able to do with the page
    - Each final picture will be a link that opens from gallery-source.html, which will show the specific information about that drawing
- `about.html`
    - This will have only text describing Pallas Creations and links to go back to any other page
- `contact.html`
    - This will have a page where people will be able to send me emails about questions
- `gallery-source.html`
    - This file won't be visible and will only be used to store the descriptions for each step in a drawing
