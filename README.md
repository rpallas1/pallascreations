## Pages

- Home Page

### Home Page

- I want this page to have a quick intro into what Pallas Creations is along with a couple of drawings for users to see right away. Under that maybe some quotes from people that have commented on my drawings. And in the footer, have buttons to visit the other pages 

### Gallery Page

- Have a quick explanation of what the gallery is and then have the final draft of all my drawings. Make it so that each drawing will be able to be clicked and users will be able to see what the process of the drawing was like, along with a brief description of each step

### About Page

- Have a description of what Pallas Creations is, how it started, and where I plan to take it
